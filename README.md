Note: Schedulant is a project based on Typescript React, it is designed specifically for React projects, so it cannot work properly in non-React projects.

## What is Schedulant
* Schedulant is a fully responsive Gantt Chart React Component, designed specifically for project management and scheduling. It includes two sections: the left side outlines a list of tasks, while the right side has a timeline with schedule bars that visualize work.
* Schedulant can assist you in planning for the success of each project. The flexible Gantt Chart in Full Schedule allows you easily collaborate with your team on the timeline, track the progress of projects, and keep the team's workflow running smoothly and efficiently.

## Key Features
* Schedulant supports simple configuration. This means that developers can quickly start using Full Schedule without the need for complex setup or installation processes.
* Schedulant supports custom **holiday** configuration for the timeline. This means that developers can add specifically holiday information to the timeline according to their needs, making schedule management more flexible and personalized.
* Schedulant supports visualizing important dates, checkpoints, and milestones to ensure tasks are completed on time.
* Schedulant supports  users in modifying the position of **events**, **milestones**, and **checkpoints** on the timeline by **dragging** with the mouse.
* Schedulant supports **day**, **month**, **quarter**, and **year** views. This means that users can choose the view that best suits their needs and preferences to view and manage their schedule.
* Schedulant supports **exporting images**. This means that users can export their schedule or project timeline in the form of images, which is convenient for sharing and archiving.
* Schedulant supports **customizing row height and column width**. This means that users can adjust the row height and column width of the schedule according to their needs and preferences, making the display of the schedule more in line with their visual habits.
